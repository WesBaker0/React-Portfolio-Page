## About

As an aspiring full-stack web developer, my aim is to create user-friendly applications and websites that are not only easily accessible, but enjoyable to use. I've always been a tech enthusiast and knew early on that I wanted to work in a field where I could both harness this interest and help people. I believe that building and maintaining websites is the perfect intersection of these two passions.

This portfolio page represents my first attempt at creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. To see more of my work, please visit the "Works" section of the website.

## Fun Fact

My first project was a character power comparison site called "CharTest" - you can find this in the Projects section of my portfolio.

## Works

Below is a showcase of some of my recent works:

* CharTest - A character testing project built using HTML and CSS.
* DreamerGPT - A project demonstrating my ability to work with backend serverside APIs.
* JavaScript - A current place holder for my last project of the bootcamp.
