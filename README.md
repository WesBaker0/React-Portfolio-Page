## About

As an aspiring full-stack web developer, my aim is to create user-friendly applications and websites that are not only easily accessible, but enjoyable to use. I've always been a tech enthusiast and knew early on that I wanted to work in a field where I could both harness this interest and help people. I believe that building and maintaining websites is the perfect intersection of these two passions. the fjf njjdf fjffjfg the last thing I would wanna do when I go to sleep would be to believe in my own self worth i believe if I do this then I will be ble to know what I am saying and doing at all times. Weh I am not busy doing this at home you can fine me at tap and vine where i live to have fyun to talk to my fiends. O beleve in the art of misconception and what I mean by that is that I do not lno what that even means at all lol. Last night I said i love you to my girlfriend. vandepump rules is one of the best shows that I hve seen in a very long time. One tof the key features of this portfolio page is the fact that it ws all made 100@ from scratch. I did not use anyt bepacks to generate anytrhing the only thing that was used was font awesome in which ase i used to  render my logos for css html javascript, node js, mongo db, and rect. on my about me page I have a short description of how I made the ultimate portfolio page. One my projects page you can find 3 big projects I completed by myself. One of the most impressive things about yhe website is animation that were used in css. I think the methods in which were used shows real innovation and creativity. The first project is chartest this website is a superher api that is a search engine . A user can either look up one character individually or they can pin two characters against eachother and compare their powerstats to see who would most likewly win in a phyiscial engagment. The second website is dreamer GPT, dreamer GPT is a website that ultilizes chat gpot's openAI api to all the user to interpret their dreams. One of the benefits of this is that people can finally start seeing why they dream what they dream. Tehy can observe all their past journal entries and they clic the interpret button to render the interpretation. Once the button is clicked a message is displayed saying "DreamerGPT is thinking..." one the response from the api comes back, the message is no longer displayed and the interpretaion is presented. On the dream feed page you can view what other users have been dreaming about to see if youve been having suimilar drweam to them. for scurity reasons tyhe names of the user are l;eft anion ious becauyse some dreams are more secreative and personal than others. some are just more out there than others Oneof the most important aspeced of the wbesite the innnopation of the user that was behind ut. One the that I startnt to notice wass a fast p[ace switch of my ability to write code/ IO beigin to write sdown code incredatblky fatsd. When your in the github and want to install this project. Thje first thing you need to doo is install the nessessaruy dependenmcies. YOu can do this by tpyoing npm start in the console. The bvenefits of this includes not having to ht fchfms chjfd fdhjvbdjdf jfhbfhfn. My biggest t6hin g ht weta htbfchf vhfhfgsdhdfdfhjf jfhfgfhf jhfhf hjfgfhfjgf sjdfywsvbx hjdgye ghdgdu . OPn my contact page you can see a place where yuou can tpye the subject of the emal that you wiush to send me. nexct you can type in ur mail so I can type you back.  and lastly you can tpye a message telling me what you thing of my protfolio page of thew cvhdgfs. I absolityu ove video games I have been playing fifa foir a very loing tiume an the facinsating thing about it all is the facty that I can pla it for hours on end and not have to worry about Rime nopt flying by it is the perfact way to pasdt time when you have something to do in a fwe outs and the dont know how to change thwta your doing. My favorite movie apof all time is lord of the rings. my favorite character is gandalf the grey. he is a mair whoho uis an angelic being made by alluviar himsel;f `./ In jrr tolkiens wrok he is portray as god and gandlaf is represented as a n angel. y second fovortie character is giumli as i have gornw up I absoutewy llove his personality Teher is thifghd vjfjhdkjhdkj dkjhd. IOn the beginn the movie starts out in the shirte. O gandafl arrivesa and frodo is ther to greet him. One ery thiong in this sense is it shoes the true friend that ganfolf has with hobbits. they are not a big folk but small and proud they ove their lasnd and their way of life. and have no particular love for outsiderrs But gandalf was dirfferent. Gandalf was super importnat to the main story.
